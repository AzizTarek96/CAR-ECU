# CAR ECU
 The main objective of this project is to create an ECU that controls the motor speed and car LEDs based on user input. The ECU will take input from a keypad, interpret the commands, and adjust the motor speed accordingly. Additionally, it will provide control over the car's LEDs, allowing users to turn them on, off, or change their patterns using the keypad.
